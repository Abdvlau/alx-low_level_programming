Project Title: Recursion in C


Project Description
This project focusses on understanding and implementing recursion in the C programming language. The project aims to explain what recursion is, how to implement it, and when it is appropriate to use this programming technique. It covers both the concept and practical application of recursion in various scenarios.

Learning Objectives:
1:Understanding the concept of recursion in programming.
2:Implementing recursive functions in C.
3:Recognizing suitable situations for utilizing recursion
4:Identifying when recursion is not appropriate.

Project Requirements:

Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
File Endings: All files should end with a new line
Style: Betty style is mandatory.
Functions: No more than 5 functions per file.
Standard Library: Not allowed, except for _putchar.
Global Variables: Not allowed.
Header File: Prototypes of functions and _putchar should be included in the header file main.h
Loops: Not allowed.
Static Variables: Not allowed.

Note:
This project aims to equip you with a solid understanding of recursion and its appropriate implementation in C, following specified guidelines and standards.
