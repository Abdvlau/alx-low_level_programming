Project 0x0B - C: malloc, free


Project 0x0B - C: malloc, free
Tasks
Task 0: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

Task 1: The woman who has no imagination has no wings
Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

Task 2: He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Task 3: If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.

Task 4: It's not bragging if you can back it up
Write a function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function.

Task 5: It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe
Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

Task 6: I will show you how great I am
Write a function that splits a string into words.

Advanced Tasks
The following tasks are considered advanced and are optional:

Advanced Task 100: Argv to string
Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

Advanced Task 101: It's never too late to be what you might have been
Write a function that splits a string into words.


General Information
This project is about understanding and implementing dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc and free. It covers concepts like creating arrays, duplicating strings, concatenating strings, allocating memory for a 2D array, and splitting a string into words.


Code Style
The code follows the Betty style guide for C programming.
