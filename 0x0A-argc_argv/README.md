0x0A. C - argc, argv

This project consists of several C programs that demonstrate the use of argc and argv, which are parameters passed to a C program from the command line.

Files

0-whatsmyname.c
This program prints the name of the executable. If the executable is renamed, it will still print the new name without recompilation.

1-args.c
This program prints the number of arguments passed to it.

2-args.c
This program prints all the arguments passed to it, each on a new line.

3-mul.c
This program multiplies two numbers provided as arguments. It validates the number of arguments and prints an error if incorrect.

4-add.c
This program adds positive numbers provided as arguments. It handles various cases like incorrect inputs and prints the result.

100-change.c
This program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for an amount of money (in cents) using the available coin denominations: 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent.



Compile the programs using the provided compilation command, then execute the resulting binary files with appropriate arguments.

Additional Notes

The programs use the Betty style for code formatting.
No global variables are used.
The prototypes of functions and the _putchar function are included in the main.h header file.
The standard library is allowed for some programs.
